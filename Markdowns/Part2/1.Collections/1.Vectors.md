# Vectors
---
- Vectors allow you to store more than one 
value in a single data structure that puts all 
the values next to each other in memory
- Vectors are a collection of values of the same type
- Vectors are resizable arrays
- Vectors are stored on the heap as they are resizable

---
- `Initialize a vector`
```rust
    let mut vec = Vec::new();
```
- initializing a vector using a macro
```rust
    let mut vec = vec![1, 2, 3];
```
- `Pushing into the vector`
```rust
    vec.push(1);
    vec.push(2);
    vec.push(3);
```
- `Accessing a vector`
```rust
    let first = &vec[0];
    let second = &vec[1];
    let third = &vec[2];
```
- `Iterating over a vector`
```rust
    for i in &vec {
        println!("{}", i);
    }
```

- `PRINTING A VECTOR`
```rust
    println!("{:?}", vec);
```

## write a function that take vector as an input and returns a vector with even values
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut vec = Vec::new();
    vec.push(4);
    vec.push(2);
    vec.push(1);
    print!("{:?}", even_vector(vec));
}
fn even_vector(vector: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    // we should define type of vector using generics
    let mut vec2 = Vec::new();
    for val in vector {
        if (val % 2) == 0 {
            vec2.push(val);
        }
    }
    return vec2;
}

```
- But here we are giver the ownership of the vector to the function
- we can use a reference to the vector
```rust
// write a function that take vector as an input and returns a vector with even values
fn main() {
    let mut vec = Vec::new();
    vec.push(4);
    vec.push(2);
    vec.push(1);
    vec = even_vector(&vec); //We are not passing the ownership we are referencing
    print!("{:?}", vec);
}
fn even_vector(vector: &Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut vec2 = Vec::new();
    for val in vector {
        if (val % 2) == 0 {
            vec2.push(*val); //Here we are de referencing the NumberS
        }
    }
    return vec2;
}
```
