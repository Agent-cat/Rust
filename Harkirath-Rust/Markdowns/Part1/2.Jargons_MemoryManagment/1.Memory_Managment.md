# Mutability
[Reference](https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/rust-bootcamp/Rust-Bootcamp-11)

- Immutable variables represent variables whose value cant be changed once assigned
```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i8 = 1;
    x = 2; // Error because x is immutable
    println!("{}", x);
}
```
- By default, all variables in Rust are immutable because
- Immutable data is inherently thread-safe because if no thread can alter the data, then no synchronization is needed when data is accessed concurrently.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x: i32 = 1;
    x = 2; // No error
    println!("{}", x);
}
```

# Stack vs Heap
[Reference](https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/rust-bootcamp/Rust-Bootcamp-12)

- we store the variables whose size can be pridected `ex:` `int` , `bool`
- we store variables whose size can not be pridected and store the memory location in stack and actually store them in heap `ex:` `Strings`, `vectors` , `arrays` etc..
