### If else in Rust

---

```rust
fn main(){
    let x=0;
  if x=0{
        print!("x=0");
    }
    else{
        print!("x!=0");
    }
}

```

---

- The condition you provide to if must be a bool
- You can evaluate multiple conditions by combining if, else, else if.

## Variable assignment with if expressions

- You can also assign the result of an if expression.

- In the example below, weather is getting assigned by the result of the if expression.

```rust

let temperature = 15;

let weather = if temperature <= 10 {
    "cold"
} else if temperature <= 20 {
    "cool"
} else {
    "warm"
};

println!("The weather is {}", weather); // "The weather is cool"
```
